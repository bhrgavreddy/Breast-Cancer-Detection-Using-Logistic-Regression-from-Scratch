# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

A data science project that applies logistic regression to predict breast cancer diagnosis using structured medical data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization — all built in Python.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: `cancer_data.csv` (uploaded dataset)
- **Features**: Includes various diagnostic metrics like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, etc.
- **Target**: Binary classification — Malignant or Benign

## 🔧 Features

- 📊 Performed exploratory data analysis on cancer-related features
- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed medical records with missing value handling and normalization
- 📈 Trained a logistic regression classifier to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors
- 📉 Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- 📦 Packaged the workflow in a modular and reproducible Python notebook

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation
- Git for version control
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-logistic-regression.git
   cd breast-cancer-logistic-regression
